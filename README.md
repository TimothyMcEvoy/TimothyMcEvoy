### Hi. Most repositories here are set as private or within connected organizations. I also maintain other accounts, which may have what you are here for. If you are looking for something of mine in particular, email me at timothymcevoy@vt.edu.

Most of the version controlled work I do is pcb design, so coding is no longer the primary work on here. My current work is on the electronics for 2 satellite projects at Virginia Tech. One project is https://inspirefly.co/, and the other is through the Virginia Tech Hume Cetner for National Sercurity and Technology.
