### Hi! 
I'm an Aerospace Engineering student concentrating on space engineering, with a minor in physics. At Virginia Tech I am part of two cubesat teams, along with a few other projects... I am a payload/electronics team lead on the inspireFly satellite <br>

I am currently an intern at The Boeing Company in El Segundo, California. At Boeing I work in Electronics Product Design and Analysis Engineering for the Space Electronics division.
##### Check out some of the stuff I'm working on at Virginia Tech in these places:

###### Please note that none of the links above are up to date with current revisions, but provide a general idea of the projects I'm on. <br> On a final note, please keep in mind much of my work is in private repositories so you may not see everything here or on my public GitHub at all.
