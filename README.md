I'm an Aerospace Engineering student with an interest in electronics systems. At Virginia Tech I am part of two cubesat teams, along with a few other projects...
#### Most recently I accepted an offer to be an intern at The Boeing Company in El Segundo California. At Boeing I will be an Electronics Product Design and Analysis Engineering intern.
##### Check out some of the stuff I'm working on at Virginia Tech in these places:
